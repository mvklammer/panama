# Panama Web-Framework

Panama is an easy to use, fast and lightweight framework for creating web applications with Java. 

Panama aims to be as simple as possible but not simpler. 
Originally created as an "antithesis" to Struts and JSPs, Panama requires no configuration and uses Velocity for templating. 
Even for persistence and logging we use libraries (Ebean ORM, Simple Logging) that are easier to use and have less overhead and dependencies than 
the usual ones.
